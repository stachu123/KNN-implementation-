# KNN-implementation

This Python project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch. The KNN algorithm is a simple and widely used classification algorithm that assigns a class label to a data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
- KNN2 class: Implements the KNN classifier with support for different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine).
- fit method: Trains the model on a training dataset.
- predict method: Makes predictions for new data points based on the trained model.

Distance metrics:
- Euclidean distance: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in the feature space.
- Manhattan distance: Measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of two points.
- Cosine similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
